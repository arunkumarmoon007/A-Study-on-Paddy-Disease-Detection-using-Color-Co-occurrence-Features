The studies of plant trait/disease refer to the studies of visually observable patterns of a particular plant. Nowadays  crops face many traits/diseases. Damage of the insect is one of the major trait/disease. Insecticides are not always  proved efficient because insecticides may be toxic to some kind of birds. It also damages natural animal food chains.  A common practice for plant scientists is to estimate the damage of plant (leaf, stem) because of disease by an eye  on a scale based on percentage of affected area. It results in subjectivity and low throughput. This paper provides a  advances in various methods used to study plant diseases/traits using image processing. The methods studied are for  increasing throughput &amp; reducing subjectiveness arising from human experts in detecting the plant diseases.
